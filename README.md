# PI-Henry

Development of an app that request information from a video games API. The backend of the application consists of setting up a server which receives the information and filter information that is not relevant to the fronted. In addition to this, routes are created to make HTTP requests and a database is created in which both API information and information that the user provides (creation of video game records) is stored. The frontend is a SPA and is made up of 4 different routes: landing page, main page, page for creating video game records and page where the details of a  video game are displayed. This project was made with the following technologies: **pure CSS, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express, Google Fonts and JavaScript.**
